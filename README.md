# Hospital_WebApp
A data storage app that I created to help my family doctor store all his patient records in one place online. The UI has been created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend has been created with NodeJS and MySQL. The folder marked "Client" contains all the front-end code and the folder marked "Server" contains all the back-end code. The data that is entered in the three tables provided is stroed in an SQL database. 

The name of the app is "Syzygy" which means alignment. The future prospects of the app are endless. With more time and resources, I would like to add graphs and charts that will analyze the data that is being entered in the three tables in real-time. This would help the doctor analyze his income and expenditure and maximize his profit. It would also help him see the diagnosis and prognosis that he has made for various patients over a period of time. 

With all these features, this app can be used by small clinics, hospitals, and independent practitioners.
