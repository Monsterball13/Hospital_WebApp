# Hospital_WebApp
A data storage app that I created to help my family doctor store all his patient records in one place online. The UI has been created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend has been created with NodeJS and MySQL. The folder marked "Client" contains all the front-end code and the folder marked "Server" contains all the back-end code. The data that is entered in the three tables provided is stroed in an SQL database. 

The name of the app is "Syzygy" which means alignment.
